		<p> Farmstop is founded by brothers Bharat Reddy and Pradeep Reddy, who took up farming as their profession after their education and started farming on ancestral lands in their village. It was during this time the duo noticed the obstacles that farmers faced first hand. Though technology and money are revolutionizing farming, the profession of agriculture is still frowned upon. A significant increase in income for any farmer will help him/her in their lifestyle. This is possible when farmers actually take the cut from customers directly rather than losing it out to middlemen. The other challenges they saw were the raise in capital to grow a crop, the majority of the money being spent on chemic fertilizers, and pesticides (Approximately 50-60 Percent), If this is replaced with organic fertilizers and pesticides will bring down the capital of production and significantly increase the profits. Then came up with the idea of Farmstop.The possibility of getting 70% of the retail cost would be the best a farmer can make to see farming as a viable profession.

		<p>We at farmstop&nbsp;want to empower and educate farmers about the latest&nbsp;market trends and&nbsp;help them interact and engage with other farmers to share knowledge amongst themselves.
