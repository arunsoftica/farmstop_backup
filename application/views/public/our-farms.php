		<p> Farmstop organic farms are located in Ramasamudram Mandal of Chittoor district, AP,bordering Karnataka.</p>
<p>We have been practicing organic farming for the last 3 years and we are at the 2 nd year in conversion for organic certification.</p>
<h3 class="headingfarm">We follow stringent practices in growing crops. We use the following substitutes to grow crops.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Manure from cattle waste – Used in enriching the soil</li>
    <li>Vermicompost – Adds nutrients to the soil</li>
    <li>Biowaste decomposers – Used as foliar spray or given as a supplement to the crop via fertigation process</li>
    <li>Panchagavya – A mixture of 5 components derived from cow <strong class="textdark">Milk</strong>, <strong class="textdark">Curd</strong>, <strong class="textdark">Gau Mothru</strong>, <strong class="textdark">Dung</strong>, <strong class="textdark">Ghee</strong> .The components are mixed thoroughly and left for fermentation and the concentrate is mixed with water and sprayed on the crop.
    </li>
    <li>Top layer soil – Top layer soil in the farm is dug and mixed with water and sprayed on the crop. Top layer soil consists of good microbes that help in plant growth and control infestation</li>
    <li>Neem Oil</li>
    <li>Pongamia oil or Kanuga oil</li>
    <li>Egg shell and Yolk – This acts an emulsifier</li>
    <li>Humic Acid – Prepared in the farm</li>
    <li>Concentrations prepared from garlic.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="headingfarm" align="left">Farmstop <span style="color: #80b435;">“Organic Village”</span></h3>
<p>We have laid the foundation to develop a “Organic Village” in a 50-acre land that will host 40-50 variety of native and easily grown exotic fruits, and amidst this we intend to grow vegetables and green leaves and also shelter cattle and livestock which complement each other. Our motive is to build a sustainable village that gets all it needs within the farm.</p>
